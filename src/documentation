staticj_gendeb.f90 - Testing code, matvec was working but issue
  with solver, also issue in handling s\Delta_{\Gamma} s in 
  one of the terms

staticj_gendeb2.f90 - Fixed issued in s \Delta_{\Gamma} s, but 
  solver still not working due to one's matrix issue

staticj_gendeb3.f90 = staticj_gendeb_sc.f90 - Final working code for simply connected
  objects implemented such that linear system looks like
  (I + K) \density. Tested in test_solver.f

staticj_gendeb4.f90 - interemdiate testing code to get to static_gendeb3.f90
  Implements the system of equations discussed in the paper  
  
staticj_gendeb_final1.f90 - unified version for all genus geometries
  and varied strength of q^{+} terms in l^{-} and m^{-}.
  Matvec is implemented so linear system looks like (I+K) \rho
