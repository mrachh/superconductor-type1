test_lpapp.f - test layer potential application, nothing seems 
  to be correct after changes made

test_lpapp2.f - final testing code for layer potential application
  uses staticj_gendeb2.f90

test_lpapp3.f - testing code for intermediate layer potential 
  evaluation routines contained in src/intsurflaprep.f90. These are
  the routines that will be used in src/staticj_gendeb_final1.f90

test_lpapp4.f - testing code for intermediate layer potential 
  evaluation routines contained in src/intsurflaprep.f90 - part 2.
  These are the routines that will be used in src/staticj_gendeb_final1.f90

   

test_lpapp_curl.f - testing code for computing curl s0 of a tangential
   vector field on the sphere

test_solver.f/test_solver_sph.f - tests the solver using the final code
   staticj_gendeb3.f90

test_ab_cycle.f - test generation of ab cycles and the computation
   of harmonic vector fields on a standard 2 torus
